                    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are an IV (InterVarsity christian fellowship) small group, and all that means is that we are just a bunch of guys who want to do life together and grow in our faith!

                    <h2>What do we do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We do lots of things together, some just for fun and some that are more meaningful. We try to foster a community of accountability and encouragement. The central theme of our group is to welcome all and teach them what we have learned about the Lord, and to provide a safe place for people to work through the challenges of emerging adulthood.
